# ðŸŒ€ aUI - a gmod ui library
aUI is a UI library heavily based off of the Carbon Design System, but for Garry's Mod. aUI is a small project I decided to work on to create a nice-looking UI library for my other personal projects.

aUI is still heavily work in progress and may or may not be finished.
